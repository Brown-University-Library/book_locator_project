    <p>Notes...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorry for current lack of styling on this landing page.</li>
        <li>Clicking any of the label-links below will result in a page that appears as a continuous list. However, printing will appropriately insert page-breaks.</li>
        <li>--> Multiple-entries ARE now merged! <--</li>
        <li>Some location-codes were empty (meaning the building) -- I put in "Not-listed" -- but since I know what they should be (at least for the Rock and SciLi), I'll put in the right info.</li>
        <li>Dimensions should now be right (let me know if they're not).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Label-links...</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="{{ rock_url }}">Rock</a></li>
        <li><a href="{{ sci_url }}">SciLi</a></li>
        <li>Other -- coming</li>
